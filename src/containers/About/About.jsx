        Before transitioning into web and software development, I worked in the Food and Beverage industry as an Intern in downtown Atlanta area. While in the hotel industry, I found myself enjoying the technical and computer driven aspects of the restaurant operations which lead me to pursue a career in tech. The same interest has lead me to pursue a Full stack Web Development certification at Georgia Tech.
        My customer service, hotel experience and tech support positions bring a fresh prospective to technical roles as it showcases my detailed oriented, organizational and problem solving while creating quality products through collaborative teamwork.
        in any job I perform. When I'm not helping clients out with issues over the phone and answering their emails, I spend time taking Latin dance classes, exercising and going for hikes. Valentine Kimani is a CRM technical support of a Real Estate company with experience troubleshooting
        platform issues, using different softwareâ€™s. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React on the front-end as well as Node
        and MySQL/Mongo on the back-end to create beautiful and secure applications. My priority is developing clear, high-quality code while cultivating
        a fun and encouraging workplace culture. I interested in a new challenge.
